* Experimental SetUp

The experiments were run on a Intel Xeon E5645 @ 2.40GHz (12MB cache size)
equipped with 24GB of RAM.  The system is running Fedora 27.  The program was
compiled with GCC 7.2.1 with the "-Ofast" and "-march=native" compiler flag.

Execution times were collected with the performance governor enabled (CPU at
maximum speed).  The execution time, reported in the table in microseconds, are
the result of a single run of the program without any performance
instrumentation.  The memory usage results were colleced in a successive run
with Valgrind's /massif/ tool.
